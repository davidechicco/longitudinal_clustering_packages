# Longitudinal clustering R packages

## Requirements
To run the scripts of this repository, the user needs to have installed:
* R (version >= 4.1)
* R libraries: `pacman`, `lcmm`, `mixAK`, `traj`, `kml3d`, `dplyr`, `reshape2`

The scripts will install directly the missing software libraries on the computer where they are executed.

## Execution
The scripts can be executed this way:

`Rscript kml_example.r`

`Rscript lcmm_examples.r`

`Rscript mixAK_example.r`

`Rscript traj_example.r`
